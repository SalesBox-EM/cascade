                            Smart technology, like AI and automated tools, can analyze data, predict trends, and provide actionable insights. However, when implementing this type of tech, many are likely to have misgivings; there are enough cautionary tales about AI to make even the most forward-thinking professionals question society's current progression.

Then, in June 2023, a survey by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2023/03/31/goldman-sachs-predicts-300-million-jobs-will-be-lost-or-degraded-by-artificial-intelligence/?sh=46b1e4c6782b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className='text-base text-blue-600 underline hover:text-blue-800 ease-in transition-all duration-100'>Forbes Advisor</a> revealed 76 percent of consumers are concerned with misinformation from AI tools. With rumors about smart technology's impact on jobs and its potential for inaccuracy, many businesses choosing to implement it are likely to be nervous.

This is not only because someone must push the button when implementing the latest tech but also because there needs to be a person to take responsibility for the outcomes, positive or negative.</p>
                    <p>As more businesses adopt smart technology, organizational leaders must understand how it works, the problems it presents, and the value it can bring.

                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            Silos within organizations can cripple collaboration and stifle innovation. This can lead to a lack of shared vision, information hoarding, minimal transparency, and fierce competition. Together, these effects have the potential to create a toxic workplace that demotivates employees, preventing an organization from progressing. Silo-busting initiatives, however, are sometimes met with resistance and skepticism.

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Pervasive yet invisible, the responsibility of eradicating barriers built by the silo effect lies with C-suite executives and business leaders. Fostering a cohesive and agile organization requires active involvement in implementing supporting systems and processes through a top-down approach. Execs must lead by example and demonstrate their commitment to collaboration. An external expert is often necessary to work with business leaders to identify and dismantle these silos effectively.

                            Research from the 2018 <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0148296318303151" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className='text-base text-blue-600 underline hover:text-blue-800 ease-in transition-all duration-100'>Journal of Business Research</a>  suggests executive engagement in cross-functional teams can create a cascading effect, encouraging others to collaborate beyond their immediate domains. Findings emphasized that when senior leadership actively participates in — and champions — change, it often leads to increased employee engagement, successful strategy execution, and improved organizational performance.

                            In 2020, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/insidetrack/blog/how-microsoft-used-change-management-best-practices-to-launch-a-new-business-intelligence-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className='text-base text-blue-600 underline hover:text-blue-800 ease-in transition-all duration-100'>Microsoft</a>  set out to implement sales automation tools to track sales and operations across their regions and job roles more effectively. Their old system lacked automation and resulted in various challenges related to data misalignment, duplication of efforts, and compliance issues. Despite many obstacles, Microsoft's leaders were determined to develop a new solution. However, employees can resist smart tech transformation even at an organization like Microsoft.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>To overcome the barriers to change, Microsoft used the ADKAR model. This model prioritizes awareness and desire as the two first goals organizations looking to change should focus on. Next, it moves on to knowledge and ability during the transition phase. Then, finally, reinforcement, which focuses on the future after the implementation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Microsoft's leadership team created a constantly changing environment to improve and adapt the platform to their employees' needs. This meant assigning leaders to champion the change, inclusive bi-weekly meetings to prioritize the project's needs, action plans for adoption, and structured feedback channels.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The ADKAR model highlights the importance of leaders in a company-wide alignment and motivation toward change. The model recognizes that businesses can successfully implement significant changes by establishing awareness and desire across the organization and assigning leaders to champion it.
