                    </p>
                    <p>Business leaders must understand how to leverage AI to remain competitive in the new digital landscape. But, even more crucially, they must understand their part in ensuring their business embraces the change.
                    </p>
                    <p>As execs are generally responsible for widespread organizational change, many are already grappling with the ins and outs of driving company-wide adaptation. And while these processes come in many forms, they must cascade from the top down for sustainable implementation; to lead effectively, one must provide a top-level business vision. </p>
                    <p>AI and the ever-evolving tech element are no exception. An AI/tech strategy must align with corporate and departmental goals so everyone can understand the value, ensuring company-wide alignment and support. By breaking down AI's effects and benefits at a department level, one can inspire department heads and team leaders to embrace the change and support a smooth transition.  </p>

                            The industrial revolution meant mass job loss for many countries. Now that AI is becoming increasingly human-like, accurate, and accessible, many feel it presents a similar threat to their jobs, which can easily translate into a resistance to change. However, while this may be accurate in some cases, AI can allow people to grow professionally by focusing on more interesting, creative, and fulfilling tasks. This is why training and upskilling are essential when implementing AI.

                            Although, by large, algorithms have less prejudice than their human counterparts, they can amplify biases presented in training data, leading to unfair discrimination of groups of people. Therefore, organizations must ensure fair and accurate AI system training. Further, AI can affect society and the economy more broadly than business interests. Execs should be mindful of these impacts and ensure the use of AI technologies benefit all stakeholders.

                            As AI systems become more autonomous, it becomes difficult to determine who is responsible for their decisions and actions. Clear checks and frameworks must be agreed upon to manage accountability and assign responsibility when using AI. It is also challenging to understand how AI systems arrive at certain decisions. Algorithms must be easy to interpret so users can understand the reasoning behind the outcomes.

                            AI requires large amounts of data.

Moreover, AI systems are vulnerable to cyberattacks and manipulation. Safeguarding these systems against threats and preventing attacks is essential for ethical AI implementation.

                            Despite initial reluctance from many people, AI is here to stay. When discussing AI within an organization, one must reassure people that their jobs are safe, explaining how AI will benefit them and their teams. Besides, many roles will still require a human touch; recent advances in AI, like ChatGPT, do not mean there won't be a place for leaders and managers in the future. Instead, it means businesses must adapt.
